	Beijing formerly romanized as Peking,is the capital of the People's Republic of China, the world's second most populous city proper, and most populous capital city. The city, located in northern China, is governed as a direct-controlled municipality under the national government with 16 urban, suburban, and rural districts.Beijing Municipality is surrounded by Hebei Province with the exception of neighboring Tianjin Municipality to the southeast; together the three divisions form the Jingjinji metropolitan region and the national capital region of China. Beijing is very large and very spread-out.  The city still follows the basic outline of the Imperial City with a clear north-south and many streets following a grid.  The loop line of the subway and the second-ring road roughly correspond to the location of the city wall, most of which was destroyed.  The Forbidden City (Gugong) and Tiananmen Square lie in the center of the city. 

The area around the Forbidden City once housed officials and nobles.  Many of these residences can still be seen in the  hutongs or alleys that are one of the highlights of a visit the city.

			<p style="margin-top: 75px;">
			In other parts of the city, the old alleyways are being quickly destroyed in order to make way for new development.Several blocks to the East of the Forbidden City is Wangfujing, a bustling pedestrian-only shopping street and the location of several popular hotels.  Although no location is Beijing is within walking distance of all of the sites, Wangfujing is a twenty-minute walk from Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City.

To the Northeast of downtown is Chaoyang District, which is home to many of the cities expat community and also the location of a large number of hotels that cater to foreign guests.  Further out to the Northwest is the Great Wall at Badaling, which is one of the closest sections of the wall to the city, but also the most touristy section.  The international airport lies to the northeast of the city, and about 30-40 minutes from downtown by taxi, although heavy traffic can make the trip much longer.    

Northwest of downtown is Haidian District and the location of many of Beijing's universities including Beijing University and Tsinghua University.  The Summer Palace is also located to the northwest of town.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 100px; ">Major rivers flowing through the municipality, including the Chaobai, Yongding, Juma, are all tributaries in the Hai River system, and flow in a southeasterly direction. The Miyun Reservoir, on the upper reaches of the Chaobai River, is the largest reservoir within the municipality. Beijing is also the northern terminus of the Grand Canal to Hangzhou, which was built over 1,400 years ago as a transportation route, and the South–North Water Transfer Project, constructed in the past decade to bring water from the Yangtze River basin.The urban area of Beijing, on the plains in the south-central of the municipality with elevation of 40 to 60 metres (130–200 feet), occupies a relatively small but expanding portion of the municipality's area. The city spreads out in concentric ring roads. The Second Ring Road traces the old city walls and the Sixth Ring Road connects satellite towns in the surrounding suburbs. Tian'anmen and Tian'anmen Square are at the center of Beijing, directly to the south of the Forbidden City, the former residence of the emperors of China. To the west of Tian'anmen is Zhongnanhai, the residence of China's current leaders. Chang'an Avenue, which cuts between Tiananmen and the Square, forms the city's main east-west axis.</p>
